# The HelpHub 

Welcome to the Help Hub. This is a place where clients can request help for various issues and receive real-time support from service workers via "help tickets" that contain their specific request.

* Once a request for help is sent from the customer it is logged in the Hub.
* Once the Hub has received the request, it assigns a unique identifier in the form of a 'ticket number.'
* The Hub assigns each ticket to a 'Worker' for assignment.
* When the help is 'delivered' and is complete, the worker sends confirmation to the Hub.
* The Hub logs the completion and closes the ticket.
* Everyone goes home happy.

### Credit and Co-Conspirators

This lovely code was largley written by the immaculate **Andrew Enyeart** and **Jacob Choi**. **Joey Hernandez** dutifully provided snarky commentary and moral support, some coding, some writing (as you are reading) yup. No one is really sure where **Dario Diorte** is at the moment, but we are hoping for a full recovery.
