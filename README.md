# The HelpHub 

Welcome to the Help Hub. This is a place where clients can request help for various issues and receive real-time support from service workers via "help tickets" that contain their specific request.

## Problem Domain

- Build a application with a support/service center where customers place requests for help (tickets) and service workers assist and close tickets.

## User Stories

- As a Customer, I want to request help and have a Service Worker assist me.
- As a Service Worker I want to be assigned a help ticket assigned to a Customer's id.
- As a customer, I want to alert the system when I place in a help request and a ticket has been issued to me.
- As a service worker, I want to alert the system when a "help" ticket has been requested.
- As a service worker, I want to alert the system when the "help" ticket is in progress with the customer.
- As a customer, I want to alert the system when help is in progress. 
- As a service Worker, I want to alert the system when the "help" ticket is complete.
- As a Customer, I want to be disconnected and my help ticket closed when "help" is complete.

### Credit and Co-Conspirators

This lovely code was largely written by the immaculate **Andrew Enyeart** and **Jacob Choi**. **Joey Hernandez** dutifully provided snarky commentary and moral support, some coding, some writing (as you are reading) and, yup. No one is really sure where **Dario Diorte** is, we were thinking homing pigeons next, maybe.
